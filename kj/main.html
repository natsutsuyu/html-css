                Klara Böhringer is an inventor from Germany who was born to one parent with
                Germanic ancestry. A nominee for the Distinguished Inventor award, Böhringer
                became the lead for Kingdom's R&D department at the age of 18. Incredibly successful,
                she had many breakthroughs during her time at Kingdom with several of her creations
                and innovations.

            <p class="text second-text">
                Böhringer was the fourth agent to join the VALORANT Protocol as "Killjoy". She earned
                her call sign after her team initially used it to compliment her outstanding skills
                that reduced the amount of work the rest of them had to do, with Klara deciding to keep
                the nickname. Killjoy now continues her innovative work as an agent of VALORANT and the
                protégé of the organization's commander, Brimstone.Killjoy always shows excitement at the
                opportunity of being able to use the technology she builds to its fullest extent, as well
                as the chance to retrieve additional knowledge.

            <li>An “Alarmbot” that is placed in a single location and detonates when enemies are in range, applying a
                vulnerability debuff to those caught in its blast. Similar to Cypher’s tools, the “Alarmbot” can be
                recalled.</li>

            <li>A stationary turret that can be deployed to fire in a 180 degree cone. You can recall the turret,

                Killjoy’s ultimate ability, “Lockdown,” does what it says on the tin. After a lengthy setup, the device
                captures all enemies caught within its radius for eight seconds. The device can be destroyed by enemies.

                A “Nanoswarm” grenade — though grenade may be a misnomer. After throwing the device, it goes quiet and
                can be activated on command, similar to Cypher’s “Cyber Cage” ability, to unleash a lasting circular
                field of damage.
